# Polyglot Bazel (polyglot-bazel)

> NOTE: Under active development, will be ready by 15 Feb 2023.

A template project for quickly setting up polyglot Bazel projects 
for Go, Java, and Python. The intention of this project is to keep an
up-to-date template for creating new projects without the headache of
copy-and-paste setup.

## Includes

1. GitHub Workflows.
2. Bazel WORKSPACE.
3. Protocol Buffer Example (api).
4. A service and client implementation in Go, Java, and Python.
5. An example Documentation Site, ready for GitHub Pages.
6. Additional helper files for making building easier.
